# Robotic-Navigation-And-Computer-Vision
Programming a robot to navigate and recognize images

Using a TurtleBot and the Robotic Operating System (ROS), I implemented a script for the TurtleBot to be able to navigate around a maze. 
Rviz was used for the mapping of the maze. OpenCV was used to detect and identify posters in the maze.
Gazebo was relied upon for simulation and testing before working on the real TurtleBot.

You can watch the video demonstration to see the TurtleBot spinning around to locate itself, look for posters, 
navigate to different locations within the maze to make sure it found all posters.
